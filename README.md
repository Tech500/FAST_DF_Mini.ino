# FAST_DF_Mini.ino

ESP32 Project using Powerbroker2's "DFPlayerMini_Fast" library for a mp3 player "reward"; code is intended for a game feature to be included in a game under development.
Thanks to Powerbroker2; this sketch can be incorporated into other projects easily.

Sketch was coded for a ESP32, Devkitv1 and uses GPIO 19 no "monitor" if mp3 is playing or has finished.

Wire connecting GPIO 17 to DF Mini Player, RX has a pull down resistor of 1 Megohm.

Coded using a DFPlayer Mini HW-247A (GD3200B).
